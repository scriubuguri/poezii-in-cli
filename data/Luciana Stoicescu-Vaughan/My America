I feel sorry for you, America!
Since we met each other
Our destinies merged
And seemed so much alike.
Never for better but
Always and steady for worse.
Looking at you
I can see myself
Struggling to conquer
The mission impossible
Of our times.


We are reaching the stage
Hand in hand,
When we will be just memories
Written somewhere in a book
By the generation of wonder


What happened to us
And how we disappeared
In the weird reason
Of the eternal Once upon a time...


Oh, beautiful land,
The hope of the many
And dream of the dreamers!
I silently cry in your sorrow
Daring to wish in my heart
An unexpected and better turn
For tomorrow.
