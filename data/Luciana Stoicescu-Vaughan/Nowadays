I learned not to cry

Unless I can&#39;t hold it.

The people around

Are running away

Saying: Forget it!


How are you doing?

Thanks, I&#39;m doing fine

It does not matter if

You&#39;re sad or suffer

No one will give a dime.


They want to see success,

Money, fame and power.

You have to hide the truth

That your life is sour.


Depression is a shame,

Melancholy - a stigma -

Who wants to be around

Someone who lack charisma?


Go party, spend some money,

Show that you have some fun,

Smile with or without reason (!)

Nobody then will run.
